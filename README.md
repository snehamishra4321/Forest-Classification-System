# Forest-Classification-System
### Analysed the forest dataset to determine the forest cover type using ML models and EDA.

### Applied various classification models using algorithms such as Support vector machines (SVM), Random Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour, Normal Bayes classifier, etc to find optimal method to classify forest cover type with hyperparameters tuning.

### Created visualizations for anomaly detection and used cross-validation for enhancing prediction accuracy by 8% along with increase in performance parameters between models.
